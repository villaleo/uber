# Uber Clone

## About the App
Shortly after beginning my SwiftUI journey, I began this project. After my internship, I've been obsessed with Uber's UI/UX and thought about attempting to replicate it.

Here is my attempt at replicating Uber's Rider App. The GIF below demonstrates a user requesting a ride.

You can see that there is a working pricing model that calculates the trip price dynamically, depending on ride type and the distance of the trip. 

## Technology
The app is built using Swift and Apple's app-development framework, SwiftUI. I took an iOS development course and am certified (my certificate is available in my [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/villaleobos/) page) for developing iOS apps using an older framework, UIKit.

I used UIKit throughout the length of my training, but shortly after gained curiosity over SwiftUI. To say the least, I gave it a shot and immediately fell in love. SwiftUI is gorgeous and make app-development fun, exciting, and rewarding.
